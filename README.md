# Hello-World
Entering the huge world

Good Evening, boi.
Nickname's Lhusckas(even though I don't know how to say it), but you can call me Lucas - guess it's obvious because of my nick.
I Like JavaScript, but Python is too damn good, even though I don't know a lot about it yet.
I'm studying at a University called Unip.
That's all, bois.
